To Run the application

Make sure to have node 12 plus will do (I had - v14.16.1)

Install the dependencies (npm install)
Run the unit test cases (npm test)
```
cd src/
npm install
npm test
node index.js
```

It then waits for you to provide test data like:
```
PLACE 1,2,EAST
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT
```
Press ```ENTER```  after ```REPORT``` (or last command)
and then close (CTRL + C) to get the output.
